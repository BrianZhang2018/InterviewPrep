1. Run Java with more memory: java -Xmx256M for example to run with 256 Megabytes. Use more if needed and you have lots of RAM.

2. Cache your calculated hash values as suggested by another poster, so each object only calculates its hash value once.

3. Use a better hashing algorithm. The one you posted would return the same hash where a = {0, 1} as it would where a ={1, 0}, all else being equal.
