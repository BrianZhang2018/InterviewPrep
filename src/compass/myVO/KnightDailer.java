 * CHALLENGE: Dial Pad Chess Knight
 * <p>
 * Suppose you have a phone dial pad like below. A chess knight starts
 * on the number 0. The knight moves according to the same rules as in
 * chess. So, from 0, it can move to either 4 or 6. From 4, it can move
 * to 3, 9, or back to 0.
 * <p>
 * 1 2 3
 * 4 5 6
 * 7 8 9
 *   0
 * <p>
 * How many unique numbers can we dial with n moves of knight? The knight always begins on 0.
 * <p>
 * Examples:
 * countNumbers(1) = 2. [04,06]
 * countNumbers(2) = 6. [040,043,049,060,067,061]
 * countNumbers(3) = 12
 * countNumbers(4) = 32
 * countNumbers(5) = 64
